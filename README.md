# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple, fast-paced two-player game, often played on paper or digitally. It is a strategy-based game where each player takes turns marking a 3x3 grid with their respective symbol: one player uses "X," and the other uses "O." The goal is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three matching symbols.
